# Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps Course Demos

This repository contains all the "handout" materials for my [Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps course](https://talkpython.fm). This includes **try it yourself** and **finished** versions of the 10 apps.

Not familiar with my Python jumpstart course? Here's a quick intro video.
